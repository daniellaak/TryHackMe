## Task 1: Deploy the machine
Deploy the machin and get a Target IP Address. I used a Kali virtual machine so I connected using OpenVPN.

## Task 2: Compromise the System
1. Scan the machine, how many ports are open?
I started by performing a port scan on the host using Nmap. The -sC and -sV flags ensure that basic vulnerability detection scripts are run against the target and that the scan attempts to identify the versions of services running on open ports.
